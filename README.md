# Hapi-Basic-Auth

This Repo is an attempt to try hands on NodeJs with Hapi Framework. It includes the usage of Basic Node Packages essentially used while developing a NodeJS application. This is full authentication API covering sign-up, sign-up, reset-password, forget-password modules. Tried to achieve the directory structure that resembles a typical MVC application.
